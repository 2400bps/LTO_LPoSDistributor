 *
 * This is Plukkie's version of the LPoSDistributor script, a revenue sharing application for the WAVES blockchain
 * Many thanks to original version of Marc Jansen and the fork of W0utje.
 *
 * I call this version "The lazy one', due to the automated nature. Only edit once when you install , no more.
 *
 * I do not have any worth mentioning coding experience. In my daily job, I am a hardcore network architect.
 * But I was always inspired by application programming and network automation. I am lazy and like to automate.
 * With my analytic skills I decided to put some effort in javascript and figure out how the original script works.
 * And came to the conclusion that it is worth to make it more 'lazy' style of paying out transaction fees.
 * I am a strong believer of decentralized banking and I like blockchain and you're never to old to learn stuff.
 * Hope you forgers enjoy my contribution to the community.
 *
 * Donations are welcome if you like this version of the script: 'The lazy one'
 * - you can send waves to wallet alias 'plukkie'
 * - you can send your lease to waves alias 'plukkieforger'
 * 
 * Thank you and Enjoy!

Version 1.1
-----------
- date 8 november 2018

- Added queueing mechanism, that stores a batchID for every collection session when finished
  
  Collector sessions ('node appng.js OR start_collector.sh') are added to a payment queue file (payqueue.dat) when finished.
  This way you can run session after session, without doing immediate checks or payments if you like. Every session
  is written with it's batchID to the queue file and the payoutinfo is logged to payoutfiles with it's batchID added
  to the filenames.
  The checkPaymentsFile.js script for checking and the massPayment.js for actual payments automatically scans the
  queue file and sequentially do their respective jobs with a nice screen print of results

- Checking payments with checkPaymentsFile.js now automatically scans the payqueue.dat file and ends with the sum of
  all payment jobs. This way you get an idea of the total payments that will be done

- Removed the fee calulation for tokens rbx, mer and bearwaves from the script (sorry w0utje).
  Due to the feature 'sponsored coins' this is obsolete.

- Added various error handlers, to avoid script crashes or detect when people would edit files by hand
  - like no payqueue.dat file
  - duplicate batchIDs would be detected (this only happens if you would modify the batchinfo.json by hand,
    which normally is not needed at all)
  - missing batchinfo.json file
  - missing directory where succesfull payout files will be stored (it's autmatically created then)
  - detect when the payment stop block is larger then the current blockheight of the blockchain
  - and more...

- MassPayment.js is now modified to handle a crashed session, if the payqueue has multiple jobs.
  If a massPayment session crashed, just make note of the batchID and the last succesfull transaction counter,
  and edit the variables const crashconfig = {
			=>	batchidstart: '0',
			=>	transactionstart: '0' }

  Change the numbers in the massPayment.js file and start the massPayment session again and you should be fine.
  NOTE: The transactionstart nr should be the last succesfull number + 1

- MassPayment.js:
  - After succesfull ending of all transactions of a batch, the batchID is removed
    from the payqueue.dat
  - After succesfull ending of all transactions of a batch, the leaserpayout and logfiles are moved
    to the folder paymentDone/
    This gives you the possibility to check afterwards payment jobs with logs.
  - automatically created a backup of the payqueue.dat file, which holds all payment batches 

- Added CHANGELOG.txt to track changes to the versions of the script

- Added various minor cosmetic errors of the script
================================================================================================================
 * V 1.0
 * Plukkie's edit of W0utjes's LPoSDistributor V 2.0.3
 *
 * CHANGES
 * - Created seperate batchinfo.json for initial key/value pairs, which are updated after a successfull run
 *   After each succesfull run the following XXXXX values are updated;
 *       "paymentid": "XXXX",
 *       "paystartblock": "XXXXX",
 *       "paystopblock": "XXXX",
 *   The difference between paystart/paystop block will be the blockwindowsize setting
 *
 * - Possibility to set blockwindowsize = X, where X defines how many blocks will be scanned for payments
 *
 * - Possibility to set wallet addresses in the variable 'nofeearray [ ];' which will NOT get revenue sharing.
 *   This can be used if you are rewarded with leases, which do not expect payout from you
 *   Default it's empty, so all incoming leasers get revenue sharing
 *
 * - Added paymentid which complements the '<leaserpayoutfilename> + <paymentid>' to make the payoutfiles unique to every session.
 *   All files are stored now and actual payouts with masspayment script can be done for every unique payout files
 *
 * - Added logfile creation after a succesfull session which summarizes relevant info, which can be used for reference or analysis
 *   This is the '<leaserpayoutfilename>.log'
 *
 * - Added bash script 'start_collector.sh' which optimizes some runtime variables of 'node' binary
 *   This can be used if regular execution of the appng.js script gives problems and terminates with errors
